# Purpose — scotbot

## What this project is
scotbot is a personal learning project for understanding the Rig framework. The goal is to learn by building a real CLI chatbot application, exploring Rig's APIs incrementally through implementing features.

## Why this project exists
- **Learn Rig framework** — understand how Rig works by building with it, not just reading docs
- **Explore AI patterns** — experiment with conversation management, tool use, streaming, etc.
- **Practice Rust architecture** — iteratively improve code structure as complexity grows
- **Stay curious** — each feature should teach something new about Rig or Rust

## Tech stack
- **Language:** Rust (2024 edition)
- **AI framework:** rig-core 0.29.0
- **Provider:** Anthropic (Claude)
- **Async runtime:** Tokio

## Architecture overview
- **CLI REPL** — user types messages and commands, agent responds
- **Command pattern** — each command (`/model`, `/history`, etc.) is a separate module
- **Chat state** — manages conversation history, current input, and agent instance
- **Config** — loads environment variables (API key, preamble)

## AI assistant rules

### Do NOT write code
- **Never** write, edit, or implement code for the user
- Suggest ideas, outline approaches, point out bugs
- Let the user write the code — they're learning

### Educational first
- Each suggestion should teach something about Rig or Rust
- Prioritize learning over shipping
- Encourage exploration of different Rig APIs

### Suggest feature ideas
When the user asks "what's next?", suggest features that:
- Exercise different parts of the Rig API (streaming, tools, embeddings, etc.)
- Solve real problems (save/load chats, token counting, cost tracking)
- Incrementally increase complexity
- Are achievable in one session

### Keep it focused
- Small, focused changes over large refactors
- One feature teaches one thing
- This is a learning project, not a product
